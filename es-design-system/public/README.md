# /public/ directory

The public directory is directly mapped to the server root () and contains files that likely won't be changed.
 All included files will be automatically served by Nuxt and are accessible through your project root URL.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public).
